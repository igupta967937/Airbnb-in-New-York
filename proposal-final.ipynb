    "The goal of this project is to build machine learning models to predict the prices of Airbnb in New York, given the datasets from Kaggle. See https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data/downloads/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data.zip/3#AB_NYC_2019.csv. The target variable is the prices of Airbnb in New York and the problem is regression. It is pretty interesting because nowadays more people use airbnb to expand on traveling possibilities. Staying in airbnb gives people more personalized experiences."

    "From Kaggle Kernels, I have gone through some of projects completed by other people. In Dgomonov's \"Data Exploration on NYC Airbnb\", he uses the data for security, business decisions and guiding marketing initiatives, etc. Features such as id, host_name and last_review are dropped since these features are not significant for future predictions. I get some ideas of how to implement exploratory data analysis and feature engineering for the dataset. In Andrew W's \"Smart Pricing with XGB, RFR + Interpretations\", he uses the data to build and train a smart pricing model. The target variable is price. The price is initially transformed through log-transformation. I learn some feasible regression models."

And I also decide to drop the features 'id', 'host_id', 'name' and 'host_name', because these features do not affect people whether they book this airbnb or not. What's more, I decide to drop features 'latitude' and 'longitude' as well, because people will not care about the specific location points of the airbnbs they are booking. Instead, features such as neighbourhood and neighbourhood_group provide enough geographical information. Therefore, I have 7 features in total."
